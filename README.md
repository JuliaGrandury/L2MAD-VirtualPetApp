## CSE 438: Mobile Application Development ##
# Lab 2: Virtual Pet App #

Overview:
In this lab, you will create an app to take care of your very own virtual pets! 
The app will only have one screen and simple logic, but we will use this as an opportunity to learn about creating custom layouts using Auto Layout. 
This will also be a great opportunity to learn how to program with the MVC programming paradigm and adhere to best practices in Swift.
